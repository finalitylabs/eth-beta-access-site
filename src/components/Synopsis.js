                <p>Scientists have discovered increasing instability in time as we know it. Extensive studies by the most brilliant minds of our world have reached the hypothesis that time will eventually fracture into multiple, simultaneous timelines and realities. From this chaos, heroes will arise to defend their timelines and claim dominance above all.
