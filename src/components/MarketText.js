                <p>Having a place to express the value of your in-game objects is something that has been utilized in the past in systems like the WoW Auction House, CryptoKitties Auction Contracts, or independent websites that host a place to buy and sell. In collaboration with District0x we are launching a MarketDAO with E.T.H. that will operate in a completely decentralized way. Fees will go to paying those that maintain the market network, which we believe will reduce costs over centralized market places. The security of a trustless market place that can't be shut down is an added bonus.</p>
