                    Having a place to express the value of your in-game objects is something that has been utilized in the past — in systems like the World of Warcraft (WoW) Auction House, CryptoKitties Auction Contracts, and centralized, independent websites that host a place to buy and sell. In collaboration with district0x, we are launching a marketplace for E.T.H. that will operate in a completely decentralized manner. Fees will go to paying those that maintain the Plasma market network, which we believe will reduce costs over centralized marketplaces. As an added bonus, we will have the security of a trustless marketplace that can’t be shut down.
