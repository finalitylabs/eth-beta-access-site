In collaboration with District0x we are launching a Marketplace with E.T.H. that will operate in a completely decentralized way. Fees will go to paying those that maintain the Plasma market network, which we believe will reduce costs over centralized market places. The security of a trustless marketplace that can't be shut down is an added bonus.</p>
